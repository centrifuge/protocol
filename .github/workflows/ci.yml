      # To ignore coverage for certain directories modify the paths in this step as needed. The
      # below default ignores coverage results for the test and script directories. Alternatively,
      # to include coverage in all directories, comment out this step. Note that because this
      # filtering applies to the lcov file, the summary table generated in the previous step will
      # still include all files and directories.
      # The `--rc lcov_branch_coverage=1` part keeps branch info in the filtered report, since lcov
      # defaults to removing branch info.
