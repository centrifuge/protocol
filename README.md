TODO: A main definition of what Centrifuge Protocol V3 is.

*Centrifuge Protocol V3* has two sides: *Centrifuge Pools* and *Centrifuge Vaults*. Both are deployed per chain, and enables cross-chain investment in pools. Different instances of *Centrifuge Vaults* in different chains can be used to invest in a single pool allocated in one instance of *Centrifuge Pools*.

## Centrifuge Pools

TODO: How Centrifuge Pools works

### How it works

TODO: Explain how Centrifuge Pools works

## Centrifuge Vaults

Centrifuge Vaults enable seamless deployment of Centrifuge pools on any EVM-compatible blockchain. The multi-chain protocol was designed specifically to tokenize RWAs as ERC20 tokens featuring customizable and gas-efficient permissioning. Investors deposit and redeem onchain using the ERC7540 asynchronous tokenized vault standard. Issuers can plug-and-play custom investment features through ERC20 wrapper support and accept multiple stablecoins using ERC7575. The smart contracts are immutable, rigorously audited, and controlled by onchain governance.

### How it works

![Architecture](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmW7N8beQ6TF5efwqkMndouxGub2J1jqsEhv5gXDbyqA2K)

Investors can invest in multiple tranches for each RWA pool. Each of these tranches is a separate deployment of an [ERC-7540](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7540) Vault and a Tranche Token.
- [**ERC7540Vault**](https://github.com/centrifuge/protocol-v3/blob/main/src/vaults/ERC7540Vault.sol): An [ERC-7540](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7540) (extension of [ERC-4626](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/)) compatible contract that enables investors to deposit and withdraw stablecoins to invest in tranches of pools.
- [**Tranche Token**](https://github.com/centrifuge/protocol-v3/blob/main/src/vaults/token/Tranche.sol): An [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) token for the tranche, linked to a [`RestrictionManager`](https://github.com/centrifuge/protocol-v3/blob/main/src/vaults/token/RestrictionManager.sol) that manages transfer restrictions. Prices for tranche tokens are computed on Centrifuge.

The deployment of these tranches and the management of investments is controlled by the underlying InvestmentManager, PoolManager, Gateway and Adapters.
- [**Investment Manager**](https://github.com/centrifuge/protocol-v3/blob/main/src/vaults/InvestmentManager.sol): The core business logic contract that handles pool creation, tranche deployment, managing investments and sending tokens to the [`Escrow`](https://github.com/centrifuge/protocol-v3/blob/main/src/vaults/Escrow.sol), and more.
- [**Pool Manager**](https://github.com/centrifuge/protocol-v3/blob/main/src/vaults/PoolManager.sol): The second business logic contract that handles asset bookkeeping, and transferring tranche tokens as well as assets.
- [**Gateway**](https://github.com/centrifuge/protocol-v3/blob/main/src/vaults/gateway/Gateway.sol): Multi-Message Aggregation (MMA) implementation, receiving messages from managers, sending these messages as full payload to 1 adapter and a proof to n-1 adapters, and verifying incoming payloads and proofs and sending back to managers.
- [**Adapters**](https://github.com/centrifuge/protocol-v3/tree/main/src/vaults/gateway/adapters): Adapter implementations for messaging layers.
